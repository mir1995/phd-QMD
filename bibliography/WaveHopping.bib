  abstract = {Yves Couder, Emmanuel Fort and coworkers have recently discovered that a millimetric droplet sustained on the surface of a vibrating fluid bath may self-propel through a resonant interaction with its own wave field. We review experimental evidence indicating that the walking droplets exhibit certain features previously thought to be exclusive to the microscopic, quantum realm. We then review theoretical descriptions of this hydrodynamic pilot-wave system that yield insight into the origins of its quantum-like behavior. Quantization arises from the dynamic constraint imposed on the droplet by its pilot-wave field, while multimodal statistics appear to be a feature of chaotic pilot-wave dynamics. We attempt to assess the potential and limitations of this hydrodynamic system as a quantum analog. This fluid system is compared to quantum pilot-wave theories, shown to be markedly different from Bohmian mechanics, more closely related to de Broglie’s original conception of quantum dynamics, his double-solution theory, and its relatively recent extensions through workers in stochastic electrodynamics.},

In this paper we give a completely geometric derivation of the transport equation, without using local sections and without assuming complete diagonalizability of the matrix valued principal symbol, or triviality of its eigenbundles. The term (unnamed in the previous literature) appearing in the transport equation in addition to the covariant derivative with respect to a natural projected connection is a tensor, independent of the choice of any sections. We give a geometric interpretation of this tensor, involving the contraction of the curvature of the eigenbundle and an analog of the second fundamental form with the Poisson tensor in phase space. In the non-degenerate case this term may be rewritten in an even simpler geometric form. Finally, we discuss obstructions to the existence of WKB states and give a geometric description of the quantization condition for WKB states for a non-degenerate eigenvalue-function.},

  abstract = {The connection problems associated with the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation in the presence of a general isolated cluster containing an unspecified number of complex transition points in unspecified positions can be studied by means of the phase-integral method developed by Fröman and Fröman. Any anti-Stokes line, i.e. any line in the complex z-plane on which the solutions behave as travelling waves with constant flow, must asymptotically (i.e. in the limit of large values of |z|) point in one of m +2 possible directions, which divide the region around the cluster into m +2 sectors, where m is the degree of the cluster. The tracing of these waves from an anti-Stokes line, bounding a sector, to an anti-Stokes line constituting the other boundary of the same sector is expressed by means of the Stokes constant for the sector in question. This paper examines the relation between these m + 2 Stokes constants in the general case when the transition points in the cluster may also be close-lying in the sense that it is impossible to treat them individually, when the solutions are traced. Under the assumption that the effective potential in the Schrodinger equation is a regular analytic function in a sufficiently large region containing the cluster, it is shown that the m + 2 Stokes constants are in general constrained by three algebraic relations, which are obtained for arbitrary m. The cases m = 1, 2, 3 and 4 are worked out in detail.},

The bulk of the articles in this Festschrift are of this survey form, and a few review Simon's contributions to a particular area. Part 1 contains surveys in the areas of Quantum Field Theory, Statistical Mechanics, Nonrelativistic Two-Body and \$N\$-Body Quantum Systems, Resonances, Quantum Mechanics with Electric and Magnetic Fields, and the Semiclassical Limit. Part 2 contains surveys in the areas of Random and Ergodic Schrodinger Operators, Singular Continuous Spectrum, Orthogonal Polynomials, and Inverse Spectral Theory. In several cases, this collection of surveys portrays both the history of a subject and its current state of the art. Exhaustive lists of references enhance the presentation offered in these surveys. A substantial part of the contributions to this Festschrift are survey articles on the state of the art of certain areas with special emphasis on open problems. This will benefit graduate students as well as researchers who want to get a quick, yet comprehensive introduction into an area covered in this volume.},

  abstract = {Chapter summaryUp to now, we have only considered single-particle systems. Real physics starts where at least two particles are involved. As a first example of a two-particle system we consider the Schrödinger equation for two free particles. This shows us how to construct two-particle states as products of one-particle states (Section 5.1). An abstract formulation of this method is given by the tensor product of Hilbert spaces. The Hilbert space of a composite system contains not only product states, but also their linear combinations (Section 5.2). In general, these states are entangled, that is, they cannot be written as simple products. Entanglement cannot be created by local measurements or manipulations of the subsystems, but usually, an interaction between the subsystems immediately leads to entanglement (Sections 5.3 and 5.4).The theory presented here has applications not only to atomic physics but also to quantum information theory. An entangled state of a composite system encodes information about the system as a whole that cannot be measured locally (that is, by measurements on the subsystems alone). This information describes correlations between the subsystems. In general, the state of a subsystem cannot be described by a state vector in the Hilbert space of the subsystem. If the bipartite system is in an entangled state, then any subsystem is in a statistical mixture of states. We describe this new situation by a density operator ρ (Section 5.5). The density operator generalizes the orthogonal projection operator onto the subspace spanned by a “pure state” ψ. In Section 5.6, we compare pure and mixed states and discuss the ensemble interpretation of mixed states. We describe the ambiguities in the preparation of mixed states in Section 5.7 and some mathematical aspects of bipartite systems in Section 5.8 (the normal form of the state vector, maximally entangled states, purification, and the projection postulate for mixed states).Section 5.9 describes the physics of composite systems whose parts are indistinguishable. A major new ingredient is the symmetrization postulate, which says that all states of the composite system are either symmetric or antisymmetic under exchange of the subsystems. Hence, one may conclude that there are two families of elementary particles, bosons and fermions. Fermions obey Pauli’s exclusion principle, which states that two fermions cannot occupy the same state. Section 5.10 describes multiparticle systems with spin, thus forming the theoretical foundation of the physics of atoms, molecules, and matter. Finally, in Section 5.11 we present the addition of angular momenta as a problem where two systems are combined into a larger system.},

  abstract = {Chapter summaryIn this chapter, we obtain the Dirac equation with external fields in three dimensions (Section 8.1). The number of components of the Dirac spinors is doubled compared to the one-dimensional situation. Roughly speaking, there are two spin components for each sign of the energy.In the presence of external fields, the Dirac equation cannot be invariant under Lorentz transformations. But the Dirac equation is covariant in the sense that a Lorentz-transformed solution of the Dirac equation is a solution of the Dirac equation with an appropriately transformed potential energy (Section 8.2). It is possible to classify the potential functions according to their behavior under Poincaré transformations as scalar, electromagnetic, and tensor fields (Section 8.3).Wave packets with negative energy behave quite differently from wave packets with positive energy if put into an external electromagnetic field. By introducing the operation of charge transformation, one can see that a wave packet with negative energy actually describes the behavior of a particle with positive energy but with opposite charge (Section 8.4). We can thus interpret the solutions with negative energy as antiparticles. But this interpretation only works in situations where the splitting of the Hilbert space in electronic and positronic states is meaningful and unambiguous. A counter-example showing the limits of Dirac theory is the Klein paradox, where particles starting as electrons may end up as positrons.In Section 8.5, we investigate the connection between Dirac’s theory and the nonrelativistic Pauli equation for particles with spin. The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Dirac equation tend to their nonrelativistic counterparts as c→∞. We derive some formulas that let us compute relativistic perturbations of nonrelativistic energies up to first order in 1/c2.The role of spherical symmetry in relativistic quantum mechanics is as important as in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. In Section 8.6, we describe the angular-momentum subspaces of Dirac’s theory. The radial Dirac equation becomes a system of two ordinary differential equations.The hydrogen atom is perhaps the most important testing ground for any quantum mechanical theory. Fortunately, the Dirac equation for a hydrogen-like system can be solved analytically, and the results are in almost perfect agreement with the measurements. This success was one of the main reasons for the quick acceptance of the Dirac equation. In Section 8.8, we solve the radial Dirac equation for the hydrogen atom by factorization methods (“supersymmetry”). The higher symmetry of the Coulomb problem in the relativistic case is related to the conservation of the Biedenharn-Johnson-Lippmann operator.},

More results will be presented from a slightly more abstract point of view in Chapter 4.We start by describing the connection between angular momentum and magnetic moment according to classical electrodynamics. Then we proceed to discuss the Stern-Gerlach experiment, which can only be explained by assuming that the state of an electron is characterized by the eigenvalues of a spin operator S. This spin operator has the properties of an angular momentum, but half-integer eigenvalues.In Section 3.5, we describe the mathematical consequences of this assumption. We construct a Hilbert space for particles with spin 1/2 and define the operators describing the components of the spin.In Section 3.6, we define the Pauli operator, that is, the Hamiltonian for a spin-1/2 particle in an external field. We discuss the solutions in a constant, homogeneous magnetic field, thereby generalizing results from Book One in Section 3.7. An important difference from the results without spin is the occurence of bound states with zero energy. This phenomenon also occurs for nonhomogeneous magnetic fields and for certain situations in three dimensions (Section 3.8).The spin is most important for understanding finer details of the spectrum of hydrogenic atoms. In Section 3.9, we introduce the spin-orbit coupling and describe the spinor eigenfunctions of the hydrogen atom and the structure of the energy spectrum.},

  abstract = {Chapter summaryThe question of whether quantum mechanics violates the principle of locality and Einstein causality has been the subject of ongoing discussions. This is relevant for the theory of quantum communication, which makes use of the “nonlocal” correlations between the parts of a bipartite system in an entangled state. In Section 6.1, we describe the Bell states of two-qubit systems and discuss their measurement by means of exchanging locally available information.In Section 6.2, we discuss the question of whether a manipulation of one qubit of an entangled pair can in any way influence the other qubit (which may be spatially separated from the first qubit). Closely related is the famous Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox, which is presented in Section 6.3. In Section 6.4, we describe the mathematical and statistical properties of the correlations arising from entanglement. In Section 6.5, we give an elementary derivation of Bell’s inequality that is based on classical ideas about the correlation of measurement results (“local realism”). It has been confirmed experimentally that quantum mechanics violates Bell’s inequality. While quantum mechanics is local in the sense required by Bell’s theorem, it appears to violate the assumption of realism (that is, the assumption that observables do have values even if they are not measured).The strange features of the correlations between the parts of an entangled system can be used for quantum information exchange. Alice and Bob can communicate rather efficiently if they share entangled pairs of qubits. The dense coding protocol describes the transmission of classical 2-bit information using a single qubit. The teleportation protocol sends one qubit with the help of two classical bits (see Section 6.6).A quantum computer (Section 6.7) applies a sequence of unitary transformations (“reversible logic gates”) to a quantum register (a system of n qubits). This transforms an initial state (the input) into a final state (the output) that is measured. In that way, any task that can be performed by a classical computer can also be performed by a quantum computer.The ability of quantum logic gates to operate on superpositions of input states can be used to do computations with all possible classical inputs in parallel. For certain problems, one succeeds in using interference in a clever way so that the final measurement gives the desired result in a few steps, where a classical computer would need many steps. In Section 6.9, we give a detailed description of a simple algorithm, where a quantum computer is more efficient than a classical computer. An overview of important quantum algorithms concludes this chapter.},

  abstract = {Chapter summaryA qubit (quantum bit) is a quantum-mechanical two-state system. Any quantum system that can have two different states can also assume an arbitrary superposition of these states. Compared to a classical bit, a qubit has a significantly higher complexity (a continuum of possible states versus two distinct states 0 and 1). But nevertheless, because the state space is just two-dimensional, the measurement of any observable can produce at most two different results.A canonical example of a qubit is provided by the spin of a spin-1/2 particle. Many ideas in this chapter are formulated with this system in mind. But there are other realizations of qubits, for example, the polarization states of photons, which we are going to discuss in Section 4.5.Because of the relative simplicity of a qubit system, it is worthwhile to review some peculiarities of quantum mechanics. In Section 4.2, we use a typical Stern-Gerlach experiment to illustrate the projection postulate, the state preparation by single-particle measurements, and the state verification by ensemble measurements (Section 4.3). We ask whether it is meaningful to talk about the state of a single qubit, and we describe how one can determine (or rather estimate) an unknown quantum state. Moreover, we discuss the impossibility of “classical” teleportation in quantum mechanics.In Section 4.4, we associate a unique “spin-up direction” with every qubit state. We describe the implementation of rotations as unitary transformations in the qubit’s Hilbert space and compute the transition probabilities between different qubit states.The strange topic of single-particle interference is presented in Section 4.6. We introduce interferometers and discuss the problems of acquiring the “which-way” information. We describe a variant of the double-slit experiment and discuss what it means to rotate a qubit through an angle of 2π. Interaction-free measurement (the detection of a bomb without actually looking at it) is presented in Section 4.6.4 as an example illustrating the meaning of the interference of probability amplitudes.Section 4.7 deals with quantum cryptography. We present an example of a secure key distribution protocol that allows one to establish a secure communication via the classical one-time pad. The security of the method depends on the fact that quantum mechanics indeed gives a complete description of the state of a qubit. In a hidden variable theory, one assumes that the state of a qubit can be described by some additional parameters whose knowledge would enable us to make more accurate predictions. Section 4.8 presents an example of a hidden variable theory and discusses its implications.We conclude this chapter with a section about the spin in a time-dependent magnetic field (Section 4.9). In particular, we discuss the time evolution in a periodically time-dependent magnetic field and the phenomenon of spin resonance, or magnetic resonance. The results are relevant for technological applications like nuclear spin tomography.},

  abstract = {Chapter summaryThe fundamental equation of relativistic quantum physics is the Dirac equation. It combines the special theory of relativity with quantum mechanics. In this chapter, we restrict our attention to free particles moving in one space dimension, leaving the more general case to the next chapter. In one dimension, relativistic particles are described by wave functions with two components, which are comparatively easy to visualize and, nevertheless, show many features of higher-dimensional solutions that have puzzled a whole generation of physicists.Dirac originally derived his equation by linearizing the classical relativistic energy-momentum relation using matrix-valued coefficients (Section 7.2). A direct generalization of the nonrelativistic interpretation of wave functions in terms of position probability densities leads to a natural Hilbert space for the Dirac equation and to a tentative one-particle interpretation (Section 7.3). In Section 7.4, we find plane-wave solutions of the Dirac equation and form (approximately) localized wave packets as “continuous superpositions” of plane waves. It turns out that the Dirac operator (the energy observable of a free particle) has a spectrum consisting of positive and negative energies. Correspondingly, the Hilbert space can be decomposed as a direct sum of subspaces with positive and negative energy (Section 7.5).Surprisingly, the kinematics of wave packets according to the Dirac equation turns out to be a rich and interesting subject (Section 7.6). The presence of a limiting velocity (the velocity of light) leads to characteristic distortions of wave packets in position space. Moreover, a wave packet with negative energy moves in a direction opposite to its average momentum. A very peculiar effect called Zitterbewegung—an oscillating motion of the average position—occurs under certain conditions for superpositions of positive and negative energies. This and other interference effects are discussed in Section 7.7. In Section 7.8, we describe wave packets in energy space and in velocity space. These are representations where the energy or the (classical) velocity are diagonal. The energy and velocity distributions are important for an analysis and understanding of a wave packet’s time evolution.The free-particle Dirac equation is relativistically invariant. The group of Poincaré transformations has a unitary representation in the Hilbert space. We discuss the Lorentz contraction of wave packets and find interesting interference effects for a velocity transformation of superpositions involving positive and negative energies (Section 7.9).},

  abstract = {Chapter summaryIn the first book of Visual Quantum Mechanics, we considered mainly one- and two-dimensional systems. Now we turn to the investigation of three-dimensional systems. This chapter is devoted to the very important special case of systems with spherical symmetry.In the presence of spherical symmetry, the Schrödinger equation has solutions that can be separated into a product of a radial part and an angular part. In this chapter, all possible solutions of the equation for the angular part will be determined once and for all.We start by discussing symmetry transformations in general. In quantum mechanics, all symmetry transformations may be realized by unitary or antiunitary operators. We define the unitary transformations corresponding to rotations of a particle in ℝ3. Their self-adjoint generators are the components of the orbital angular momentum L. We describe the angular-momentum commutation relations and discuss their geometrical meaning.A quantum system is called invariant under a given symmetry transformation if the Hamiltonian commutes with the corresponding unitary operator. A particle moving under the influence of a potential V (x) is a spherically symmetric system (invariant under rotations) if the potential function depends only on the distance r from the origin. Spherical symmetry implies the conservation of the angular momentum and determines the structure of the eigenvalue spectrum of the Hamiltonian (degeneracy). The square L2 and any component Lk of the angular momentum can be diagonalized simultaneously with the Hamiltonian of a spherically symmetric system. The structure of the common system of eigenvectors can essentially be derived from the angular-momentum commutation relations. In general, the possible eigenvalues of the angular-momentum operators are characterized by integer and half-integer quantum numbers. It turns out, however, that only integer quantum numbers occur in case of the orbital angular momentum.The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions (spherical harmonics) of the orbital angular momentum are then determined explicitly. The spherical harmonics are the energy eigenfunctions of a particle whose configuration space is a sphere (rigid rotator). The rigid rotator can serve as a simple model for a diatomic molecule in its vibrational ground state.The restriction of the eigenvalue problem to an angular-momentum eigenspace reduces the Schrödinger equation to an ordinary differential equation. We conclude the chapter with a brief discussion of this so-called radial Schrödinger equation.},

The points of closest approach are called avoided crossings; these have a distinctive geometry and are important because they determine the limits of applicability of the adiabatic theorem. This paper describes some theoretical results on the parameter space density of avoided crossings, for systems with the spectral statistics of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). These results are in good agreement with numerical experiments.},

  abstract = {Laplace’s method is a preeminent technique in the asymptotic approximation of integrals. Its utility was enhanced enormously in 1956 when Erd´elyi found a way to apply Watson’s lemma and thereby obtain an infinite asymptotic expansion valid, in principle, for any integral of Laplace type. Erd´elyi’s formulation requires tedious computation of coefficients cs for each specific application of the method, and traditionally this has involved reverting a series. Recently, it was shown that the coefficients cs can be computed via a simple, explicit expression that is probably computationally optimal, which avoids the reversion approach altogether. The formula is made possible by recognizing the central role of Fa`a di Bruno’s formula, alongside Watson’s lemma, in Erd´elyi’s formulation of Laplace’s classical method. Laplace’s method can now be implemented cleanly and relatively quickly, provided one has the luck and the patience to get to the point where implementation becomes automatic.},

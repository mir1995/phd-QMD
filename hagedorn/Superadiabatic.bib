We derive the general form of the Schrödinger equation in the               n               th superadiabatic representation for all                                                              . Using these results, we obtain closed formulas for the time development of the component of the wave function in an initially unoccupied energy subspace when a wave packet travels through the transition region. In the optimal superadiabatic representation, which we define, this component builds up monotonically. Finally, we give an explicit formula for the transition wave function away from the avoided crossing, which is in excellent agreement with high-precision numerical calculations.},

  abstract = {In a quantum system with a smoothly and slowly varying Hamiltonian, which approaches a constant operator at times t → ±∞, the transition probabilities between adiabatic states are exponentially small. They are characterized by an exponent that depends on a phase integral along a path around a set of branch points connecting the energy level surfaces in complex time. Only certain sequences of branch points contribute. We propose that these sequences are determined by a topological rule involving the Stokes lines attached to the branch points. Our hypothesis is supported by theoretical arguments and results of numerical experiments.},
